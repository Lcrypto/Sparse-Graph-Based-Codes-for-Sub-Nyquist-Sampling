====

Fast Fourier Aliasing-based Sparse Transform (FFAST) for calculating the Discrete Time Fourier (DFT) transform signals having sparse spectrum. 

The distribution contains C++ source code for the FFAST engine, demo files and MATLAB scripts that interact with the tool.

Idea behind FFAST
====

The algorithm cleverly induces sparse graph alias codes in the DFT domain, by sub-sampling of the time-domain samples. The resulting sparse graph alias codes are then exploited in a peeling decoder. 

Besides the noiseless and exactly sparse spectrum, the algorithm can handle the noisy setting. The algorithm is also observed to perform well in the case of off-grid spectra; however, theoretical guarantees are not given for that case.

Example usage
====

- Display help

        ./ffast --help

- Run an FFAST experiment `(-a)` on randomly generated signals of length 124950 `(-n 124950)` having 10 sparse spectrum `(-k 10)` 30 times `(-i 30)` 

        ./ffast -a -n 124950 -k 10 -i 30

- Run FFAST on input data saved in `inFile.txt` (-f inFile.txt)

        ./ffast -f inFile.txt
